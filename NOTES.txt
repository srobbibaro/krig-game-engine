Camera Controls:
    a,A: move camera 4 left; move camera 2 and 3 along negative X-axis        
    s,S: move camera 4 right; move camera 2 and 3 along positive X-axis
    d,D: move camera 4 backward; move camera 2 and 3 along positive Z-axis
    w,W: move camera 4 forward; move camera 2 and 3 along negative Z-axis
    r,R: move camera 4 up; move camera 2 and 3 along positive Y-axis
    f,F: move camera 4 down; move camera 2 and 3 along negative Y-axis
    z,Z: point camera 4 looking down negative Z-axis    
    1  : select camera 1 (main game camera)
    2  : select camera 2 (overhead view, can only move along terrain editing grid)
    3  : select camera 3 (normal view, can only move along terrain editing grid)
    4  : select camera 4 (free roaming camera)

Terrain Editing Controls:
    o,O: output terrain file (save terrain to ./terrains/new_terrain.txt)
    u  : undo last terrain color change only 
    U  : undo last terrain height, type and color change
    p  : paint only the select terrain color
    P  : paint terrain height, color, and type
    h  : decrease terrain height at coordinates by .05 units
    H  : increase terrain height at coordinates by .05 units
    0  : set terrain height at coordinates to 0 
    t:T: change terrain type (land or water)
    g,G: enable/disable grid

Level Editing Controls: 
    l  : load previous level
    L  : load next level
    k,K: reload current level
    ;  : assign previous loaded script to player
    :  : assign next loaded script to player  
    [  : decrease light direction's x value by .1 (normalizes and does not save)
    {  : increase light direction's x value by .1 (normalizes and does not save)     
    ]  : decrease light direction's y value by .1 (normalizes and does not save)     
    }  : increase light direction's y value by .1 (normalizes and does not save)     
    \  : decrease light direction's z value by .1 (normalizes and does not save)     
    |  : increase light direction's z value by .1 (normalizes and does not save)     
    b,B: enable/disable object bounding boxes
    c,C: enable/disable object control triangles
