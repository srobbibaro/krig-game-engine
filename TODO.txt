   * implement "setTestZoneEnable" lua function
   * determine whether it would be beneficial to over-ride "on_update" so that engine calls a different specified function
   * determine whether or not ScriptedObject::animCurrTime is necessary especially in regards to interpolation... would elaped time/ duration suffice?
